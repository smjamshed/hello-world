A repository of ideas
My name is Sina and I love to cook.
Now my kids enjoy cooking and baking so we have too many competing chefs at home.
I like creative writing.
Most of the writing I do is business writing.
I would love to get more time on my hands to finish a book, that is the goal!
Wish me luck with three kids, a full time job, and working on my masters.
A walk on the trail is the perfect way to let out some of that stress.
The to do list keeps growing.
The important thing is to be realistic on what can be achieved and when:-)
A to do list is just a to do list after all!
